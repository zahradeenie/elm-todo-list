# Elm Todo List

This is a super basic todo list application built in Elm. I built this with no tutorial, a little bit of google and a whole lot of brain power. It took a lot longer than I expected to complete this because getting used to the Elm syntax for building HTML markup takes time to get used to.

As with my todo list in Elixir, it's not very beautiful to look at but the real beauty lies in the code. I'm proud that I was able to build this with relative ease just after taking The Pragmatic Studio's [Building Web Apps with Elm](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/elm) course.
